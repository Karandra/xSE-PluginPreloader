# xSE PluginPreloader
Plugin preloader for Fallout 4 Script Extender.

Uses [KxFramework](https://github.com/KerberX/KxFramework). Use [VCPkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to get the framework as a dependency. Details on KxFramework page.
Also uses [Nukem Detours](https://github.com/Nukem9/detours). There is no VCPkg package for it. Download the repository and place its files (from the folder with `.sln` file) in `Nukem Detours\Solution` folder, build required configuration and copy `.lib` files in `Nukem Detours\x64` and `Nukem Detours\x86` folders.
